# Full Screen Nav

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rachsmith/pen/QWoXEM](https://codepen.io/rachsmith/pen/QWoXEM).

I wanted to make something to tesst out Sass directives so I created this full screen nav animate in/out with the Sass @for directive.

At the moment the sizing is a bit wack on mobile - something to do with window.innerHeight not getting the mobile viewport size
